# Organizational Decision Records (ODRs)

## Overview

This folder contains the **Organizational Decision Records (ODRs)** for the VIEWS project. ODRs document key organizational decisions, providing context, rationale, and consequences. They serve as a record of why certain paths were chosen, fostering transparency, consistency, and scalability across the organization.

## Purpose

ODRs are designed to:
- Capture the rationale behind significant organizational decisions.
- Provide a traceable history of decision-making processes.
- Offer guidance for onboarding, operational alignment, and future improvements.

By documenting these decisions, we ensure clarity and continuity as the organization evolves.

## Structure of ODRs

Each ODR follows a consistent format:
- **Title**: A concise summary of the decision.
- **Status**: Current state of the decision (e.g., proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated).
- **Context**: Background and reasons prompting the decision.
- **Decision**: The resolution or path chosen.
- **Consequences**: Implications, including trade-offs and future considerations.
- **Implementation Notes**: (Optional) Steps or guidelines for enacting the decision.
- **Review Date**: A date to reevaluate the decisionâ€™s relevance and effectiveness.
- **Decision Owner**: The team or individual accountable for the decision.

ODRs are named using a category-prefix and sequential numbering for easy navigation, e.g., `infra-001-naming-conventions.md`.

4. **Collaborate**: Address feedback and finalize the ODR for inclusion.
