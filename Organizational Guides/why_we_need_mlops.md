# MLOps for Mission-Critical AI: Building Systems We Can Trust Under Pressure"

Conflict forecasting is one of the more demanding applications of AI. But the challenges it poses  -  dynamic environments, opaque models, institutional risk, ethical exposure  -  are common across mission-critical domains. This paper uses forecasting as a stress test to explore how MLOps can become the operational backbone for trustworthy AI.


## **1. Introduction: Why MLOps Matters in Mission-Critical Contexts**

Mission-critical AI systems - such as those used to forecast famine, organized violence, or forced displacement - are deployed in environments where decisions have consequences measured in lives and livelihoods. These systems don’t merely produce predictions; they aim to shape preparedness, influence funding, and guide the allocation of humanitarian resources under immense time pressure and uncertainty. They must function in settings characterized by volatile data, shifting political constraints, and the real-time operational demands of institutions tasked with acting on early warning.

Recent literature emphasizes the growing ambition to shift from reactive aid to anticipatory action (OCHA 2023; Anticipation Hub 2023). Within this shift, AI is often presented as a key enabler - but only if it can be trusted to uphold humanitarian principles and avoid introducing new harms (Beduschi 2022; Spencer 2021). This requires more than accuracy or predictive performance. It demands reliability under stress, interpretability under scrutiny, and governance under deployment. Forecasts that cannot be audited, interrogated, or controlled - technically and operationally - in the field risk misleading decision-makers, delaying response, or unintentionally exacerbating risk. Worse still, such failures can undermine institutional trust in predictive tools more broadly, jeopardizing future efforts to use AI for anticipatory action - even when the systems improve. In high-stakes settings, governance is not just a policy requirement - it is a systems requirement, one that demands architectural commitments built into AI infrastructure from the ground up.

This is where MLOps becomes essential - not as a fashionable add-on, but as the operational scaffolding that makes governance implementable. MLOps, when properly instantiated, provides the mechanisms to ensure that AI systems are not only performant in sandbox conditions, but inspectable, interruptible, and accountable in live deployment. It offers a technical substrate for human oversight: version control, rollback protocols, data lineage tracing, testing pipelines, continuous validation, and live monitoring. In doing so, it transforms governance principles into procedural guarantees.

In this sense, MLOps is a necessary - though not sufficient - condition for trustworthy AI. It does not replace ethical deliberation or policy clarity, but it makes those commitments actionable. Without such infrastructure, calls for transparency or fairness remain aspirational at best. With it, we can begin to close the gap between governance-by-design and governance-in-practice.

This document builds on our earlier notes on “governance and ethics” and “fail fast.” There, we argued that governance must be designed into AI systems from the outset. Here, we focus on implementation: the technical architectures and institutional procedures that make trust a property of the system - not just a promise of the developer.


## **2. From Models to Systems: The Shift from AI Prototypes to Real-World Infrastructure**

Many humanitarian forecasting efforts begin as research prototypes: a promising model trained on historical data, tested offline, and evaluated for predictive performance. These early efforts are often developed in controlled conditions, with clean datasets, curated features, and generous assumptions about availability and reliability. But moving from prototype to operational system—one that informs real-world decision-making under pressure—is not a matter of scaling computation. It is a matter of engineering for uncertainty, accountability, and continuity.

Even ethically motivated models can cause harm if deployed without systemic safeguards (Pizzi et al. 2020; Leslie et al. 2021). A predictive tool that performs well in validation may still mislead or misfire when confronted with degraded input data, edge-case scenarios, or shifts in ground truth caused by new conflicts or crises. In humanitarian settings, the consequences of such failures are not academic. They affect trust, resources, and lives.

The gap between model and system is structural. A model outputs predictions; a system must support judgment. That means not just generating outputs, but contextualizing them, documenting them, and delivering them through interfaces and protocols that can be interrogated, audited, and overridden when necessary. Systems must monitor for input drift, record decision provenance, log failure cases and escalation paths, and expose points of intervention. They must account for outages, degraded performance, contested data sources, and evolving institutional mandates.

Prototypes typically assume stable infrastructure and well-scoped users. Systems must cope with intermittent internet, parallel workflows, and users who are sometimes skeptical, under-resourced, or overburdened. The transition from research to deployment is not linear—it's a transformation. Trust in humanitarian AI is a fragile fledgling—especially in institutions already burdened by pressure, scrutiny, and operational fatigue (Spencer 2021). One model failure can ripple through entire decision chains, especially if there is no mechanism to contextualize, revise, or override its outputs.

This is why infrastructure matters. Humanitarian AI must be dependable under stress, not just accurate in retrospect. That requires tooling for versioning, observability, rollback, and deployment hygiene—what the field increasingly recognizes as MLOps. These are not conveniences. They are preconditions for any system that aims to produce insight without compromising integrity.

## **3. MLOps for Accountability: Making AI Systems Inspectable, Interruptible, and Adaptive**

* Inspired by the needs identified by **OCHA (2021)**, **FAIR (XXXX)** and the **DSEG framework**, this section introduces the ACTS framework:

  **Auditable**: Trace every decision to model version, data, and parameters. Enables ex-post investigation of anomalies.
  **Controllable**: Provide kill-switches, human-in-the-loop overrides, and clear responsibility chains.
  **Transparent**: Document model logic and limits in ways understandable to both engineers and non-technical stakeholders.
  **Secure**: Prevent tampering, unauthorized access, or silent model drift through robust access controls and monitoring.

* ACTS complements ethics and legal principles by showing how to *implement* them in production systems.

## **4. Designing for Drift, Change, and Fragility: The MLOps Lifecycle for High-Stakes Forecasting**

* From the **DSEG** and **Spencer (2021)** literature: humanitarian AI must deal with data scarcity, adversarial events, and drift in both context and model behavior.

* Walkthrough of pipeline lifecycle stages:

  1. **Ingestion**  -  include data tagging (deterministic vs stochastic), source validation
  2. **Preprocessing**  -  automated data integrity checks, outlier detection
  3. **Training**  -  reproducible builds, documentation of parameters and priors
  4. **Evaluation**  -  fairness metrics, calibration, coverage via HDIs instead of percentiles
  5. **Deployment**  -  canary releases, monitoring dashboards
  6. **Post-deployment**  -  alerting, rollback protocols, automatic retraining triggers

* Reference OCHA’s peer review framework and lessons from COVID-time deployments (**Pizzi et al.**).

## **5. Case Example: How VIEWS Operationalized MLOps for Conflict Forecasting**

* Show how VIEWS embeds elements of ACTS:

  * Traceability across pipelines (e.g., log files and versioning tied to data/month)
  * Model artifacts tagged with training date and validity span
  * Fail-fast controls when data is stale or out of spec
  * Human-readable outputs (HDIs, not just percentiles) to support explainability

* You can also nod to challenges: difficulties with ensemble drift, input data imprecision, and user-facing transparency without overpromising causality.

## **6. Beyond Engineering: Why MLOps Is Also a Governance Tool**

* **Beduschi, Pizzi, and Leslie** all converge: governance without engineering fails under pressure.
* MLOps enforces ethical principles procedurally: it’s how we build *institutional trust* and *organizational memory* into tools that must outlive individual developers.
* Draw connections to:

  * **Documentation standards** (as part of model cards and metadata)
  * **Oversight scaffolding** (e.g., ethical reviewers, red team exercises)
  * **Participatory auditability** (giving stakeholders visibility into models and pipelines)
* Note the **limits of explainability**  -  trust must be earned via verifiability, not just narratives.

---

## **7. Conclusion: Infrastructure for Integrity at Scale**

* High-stakes AI systems will fail  -  the only question is **how gracefully** and **under what visibility**.
* MLOps isn’t just DevOps for ML. In humanitarian systems, it’s the backbone of *accountable foresight*.
* We cannot scale responsible AI without **scalable infrastructure** to operationalize ethics, auditability, and adaptive control.
* Trust must be *engineered, enforced, and evolved*  -  not asserted.
